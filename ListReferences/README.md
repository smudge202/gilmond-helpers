# List References

This project is designed to list all the assemblies referenced by Visual Studio Project Files (`*.csproj` & `*.vbproj`).

## Usage

Call the command line application with the full path to a solution directory you want to scan. This can also be set in the `ListReferences.CommandLine` project properties in the `Debug` tab if you want to execute within Visual Studio.
